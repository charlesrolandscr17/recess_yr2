# Context manager - is an object that defines a temporary context for a block of code
# Example 1: Demonstrate a context manager to open a file and returns a context manager instance

#         file.close()
#         print('File has been closed')

#         return __enter__, __exit__
    
# with open_file("test.txt") as f:
#     contents = f.read()

# Example 2: Demonstrate a context manager using a time series
# import time

# class Timer:
#     def __enter__(self):
#         self.start_time = time.time()

#     def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):

#         execution_time = end_time - self.start_time
#         print(f'The time for this execution {execution_time} seconds elapsed')

# # with example usage
# with Timer():
#     """measure the execution time"""
#     time.sleep(2)

# Multithreading and Multiprocessing 
""" Techniques that can be used to improve performance of a Python program"""

# Multithreading is a technique where multiple threads are created within a single process.
# Multiprocessing is a technique where multiple threads are created.

# Example of multiprocessing
# import threading

# def task(name):
#     print(f'Running task {name}')

# # create multiple threads
# threads = []
# for i in range(10):
#     t = threading.Thread(target= task, args=(f'Thread {i}',))
#     threads.append(t)
#     t.start()

# # wait for all threads to finish 

# for t in threads:
#     t.join()

# Example 4: demonstrate use of multiprocessing

# import multiprocessing
# def process_task(name):
#     print(f'Processing task {name}')

# # create a pool of processes
# pool = multiprocessing.Pool(processes=5)

# # Submit multiple task to the pool
# for i in range(6):
#     pool.apply_async(process_task, args=(f"Process {i}",))

# # Close the pool and wait for all processes to finish
# pool.close()
# pool.join()
